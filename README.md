# Academic and Extra Curricular Projects

This is a collection of cases, projects, presentations, etc. I did for college in the Univerity of the Philippines - Diliman. Each item is documented with a general overview of the case/project/presentation/etc. as well as insights gained and future applications.

Grading in my university is on a scale of `1.00` (> 97) to `5.00` (< 65) with `0.25` increments.

As I gain more knowledge and experience, I plan to revisit these cases/projects/presentations/etc. and redo them with documentations on what I did different and why I did what I did, among other things.
